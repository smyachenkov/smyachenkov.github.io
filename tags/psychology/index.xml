      <description>A couple of years ago, I started my first job as a programmer. On the first day, I entered the office, sat in my new chair, turned on the computer, checked out a project from the version control system and opened it in IDE. The first-ever piece of the code I saw looked like that:
 // TODO it works, but it&amp;#39;s ugly, rewrite function init() { 	// some code } As you may already have guessed, this code remained untouched for a couple of years, until the project became obsolete and was archived and longer used.</description>
