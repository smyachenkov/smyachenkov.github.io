      <description>Take-home assignment is the type of interview where you will demonstrate your programming skills on a somewhat close-to-real coding project. Usually, itâ€™s a description of a small project that you need to implement from scratch or a skeleton that you need to extend.
It is used mostly by small and medium companies, Big Tech and FAANG/MANGA+ enterprises rarely incorporate it into their processes.
In this post, I will share with you how to make the best out of good take-home assignments and how to deal with unfair ones.</description>
