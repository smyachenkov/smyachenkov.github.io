      <title>Two And A Half Years In GameDev</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About 3 years ago, I joined a GameDev company, without any prior experience making games or hands-on exposure to this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistically, this time is not even enough&amp;rsquo;s to release a single game. But during that window, I was lucky to meet many talented people deeply involved in modern GameDev, who shared with me their career journeys, war tales, and anecdotes, and helped me shape my vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One unexpected outcome of this switch was that many friends and former colleagues reached out to me curious about what it was like and how it is comparable to my previous experiences. A surprising amount of them revealed to me that they were secretly planning to pursue this path later in their career, or explore it as a passion project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
